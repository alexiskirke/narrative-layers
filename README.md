## 🎨 Design Philosophy

narrative layers embodies the concept that every interaction tells a story. Through carefully crafted animations, particle systems, and responsive design elements, visitors don't just view content—they experience it.

### Key Design Elements:

- **Cosmic Backgrounds**: Deep space gradients that evolve as you scroll
- **Morphing Typography**: Text that transforms and responds to user interaction
- **Particle Systems**: Dynamic, physics-based animations
- **Glass Morphism**: Translucent interfaces that feel futuristic
- **3D Integration**: Seamless blend of 2D and 3D elements

## 🌟 Customization

### Adding New Sections

1. Create a new component in `src/components/sections/`
2. Import and add it to `src/app/page.tsx`
3. Follow the existing pattern for scroll-triggered animations

### Modifying Animations

- Edit `src/app/globals.css` for global animations
- Component-specific animations are in their respective files
- Use Framer Motion's `motion` components for new animations

### Color Schemes

The project uses CSS custom properties for easy theming:

```css
:root {
  --background: #000000;
  --foreground: #ffffff;
  --primary: #6366f1;
  --secondary: #8b5cf6;
  --accent: #06b6d4;
}
